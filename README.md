This is a simple application that essentially has an introduction, a menu that takes user input then will either display a list that's already been created for you, or display a little about me or gives you the option to exit the application. I originally wanted to create an actual game of sorts where you have to do your laundry and when you're about to put your clothes in the washer you find it is broken. Then strange things start to occur. From there you would have choices to make that would be given to you from a pre-determined list. But, I wanted said list to be at least somewhat random. Also you'd have an active inventory and make choices around that too. But the scope was actually too large for the time and my skill level so I had to dial it back to what it is now.

The three features I chose are:

a master loop
Creating a dictionary or list and retrieving at least one value
Retrieving data and display based on external factor (the time was used in this case)

There aren't any special instructions to run this as what is displayed on the screen is pretty straight forward. Asks for input, you give it and you get a response back. For specificity you get asked if you want to do laundry, quit or if you want to look at the "about me". Option 1 (laundry) is what takes you to the main loop of the game.
